# Taste Skill

A collection of skills that improve how AI tools write frontend code. Instead of generating generic, boring interfaces, the AI builds modern, premium designs with proper animations, spacing, and visual quality.

## Skills

There are four skills in this project. Each one lives in its own folder and contains a `SKILL.md` file.

### 1. taste-skill
The main design skill. Teaches the AI how to write good-looking frontend code from scratch. Covers layout, typography, colors, spacing, motion, and overall visual quality.

### 2. redesign-skill
For upgrading existing projects. Instead of rebuilding from zero, this skill walks the AI through auditing what's already there and fixing the biggest design problems first.

### 3. soft-skill
Focuses on making things look and feel expensive. Covers premium fonts, big breathing whitespace, layered card designs with depth, smooth spring-based animations, and floating navigation. Bans all the generic defaults that make AI output look like a template.

### 4. output-skill
Stops the AI from being lazy. Prevents placeholder comments, skipped code blocks, and half-finished outputs. Forces the AI to actually write everything instead of cutting corners.

## How to Use

1. Copy the `SKILL.md` file from the skill folder you need into your project.
2. Tell your AI to read and follow it. In most editors you can just reference it directly (e.g. `@SKILL.md` in Cursor).

That's it. The AI reads the file and follows the rules.

## Settings (taste-skill only)

The taste skill has three settings at the top of the file. Change these numbers (1-10) depending on what you're building:

**DESIGN_VARIANCE** — How experimental the layout is.
- 1-3: Clean, centered, standard grids.
- 4-7: Overlapping elements, varied sizes.
- 8-10: Asymmetric, lots of whitespace, very modern.

**MOTION_INTENSITY** — How much animation there is.
- 1-3: Almost none. Simple hover effects.
- 4-7: Fade-ins, smooth scrolling.
- 8-10: Magnetic effects, spring physics, scroll-triggered animations.

**VISUAL_DENSITY** — How much content fits on one screen.
- 1-3: Big and spacious. One element at a time. Luxury feel.
- 4-7: Normal spacing. Like a typical app or website.
- 8-10: Dense and compact. Dashboards, data-heavy interfaces.
